Iâ€™m a PhD Student at UC San Diego, where I am advised by [Sanjoy Dasgupta](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~dasgupta/) and [Yian Ma](https://sites.google.com/view/yianma/home). I obtained my MS in Computer Science at Columbia University, where I was advised by [Daniel Hsu](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~djhsu/). Previously, I graduated from the University of Chicago with a BS in Mathematics.


*Research areas:* algorithmic statistics, machine learning, probabilistic analysis.
